Python Comments 

Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

Creating a Comment
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

Example
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
Example
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

Example
#print("Hello, World!") -- This is a comment, this won't be display in console panel.
print("Cheers, Mate!")
